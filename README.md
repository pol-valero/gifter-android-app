# Giftr - Android App

Giftr is an Android app that allows users to create their own present wishlists, and to see other user's wishlists.
It is very useful to know what present to get for a friend, and to let your friends know what you would like to receive.

### Functionalities of the app

- Sign up and log in. Log out.
- Search users.
- Add friends. See current friends. See pending friend requests.
- List all personal wishlists. Edit and delete wishlists.
- Book a present from a friend's wishlist. See which presents are already booked.
- Create and edit products, so they can be added to wishlists. Add product image.
- Create and edit profile. Add user image.
- Send messages to friends. See all open conversations.

### Things to know
We used Android Studio for the development and testing of the app.

Two APIs were used to implement some of the functionalities:
- Private university API for creating wishlists, adding gifts, creating products, booking gifts...
- "Freeimage.host" API for uploading and retrieving images.
